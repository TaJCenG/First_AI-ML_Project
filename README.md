# First_AI-ML_Project
The aim of this system is to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their stated preferences, using a rule-based approach.

Aim: The aim of this system is to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their stated preferences, using a rule-based approach.
Procedure:
1.	Gather User Preferences:
o	The system should collect information about the user's movie preferences. This can be done through:
	Explicit input: Asking the user to select their favorite genres, actors, and directors.
	Implicit input: Analyzing the user's past movie ratings or viewing history.
2.	Define Rules:
o	Create a set of rules that map user preferences to movie recommendations. Each rule should specify the conditions under which a movie should be recommended. For example:
	IF user likes "Action" AND "Sci-Fi" THEN recommend movies with both "Action" and "Sci-Fi" genres.
	IF user likes "Christopher Nolan" THEN recommend movies directed by "Christopher Nolan".
	IF user likes "Leonardo DiCaprio" AND genre is "Drama" THEN recommend "Drama" movies starring "Leonardo DiCaprio".
	IF user rates a movie highly (e.g., 4 or 5 stars) THEN recommend movies from the same genre.
3.	Match Rules to User Preferences:
o	When a user requests a movie recommendation, the system matches their preferences against the defined rules.
4.	Generate Recommendations:
o	Based on the matched rules, the system retrieves a list of movies that satisfy the rule conditions.
5.	Rank Recommendations (Optional):
o	The system can rank the recommended movies based on additional criteria, such as:
	Average user rating
	Release date
	Popularity
	Relevance to multiple matched rules
6.	Present Recommendations:
o	The system presents the list of recommended movies to the user.

Program Output
The program will output a list of movie titles that are recommended based on the user's input. The output could also include:
•	Movie details (genre, director, actors, synopsis)
•	Explanations of why each movie was recommended (which rules were matched)
•	A ranked list of recommendations
 
Result:  The effectiveness of the rule-based system depends on the quality and comprehensiveness of the defined rules.
•	Expected Results:
o	The system should provide relevant movie recommendations that align with the user's stated preferences.
o	The system should be able to explain the reasoning behind each recommendation, increasing user trust.
•	Potential Issues:
o	If the rules are too specific, the system may not be able to provide recommendations for users with unusual or niche preferences.
o	If the rules are too general, the system may provide recommendations that are not very relevant to the user.
